Write a C/C++ program to implement producer-consumer problem with Peterson’s algorithm.
In your program, you create two functions (i) void producer(queue *) for producing a number of items, and (ii)
void consumer(queue *) to consume the items created by the producer.

 You cam create a shared memory using shmget(), shmat(), shmdt(), and shmctl() system calls. Then implement a circular queue (bounded
buffer) in the shared memory, where the producer stores the produced item and consumer communes the
items from the queue. In order to synchronize the produce and consumer operations, you must use the
Peterson’s algorithm.
