# Operating System Codes Repository

Welcome to the repository for operating system codes! This repository contains implementations of various concepts in operating systems, including process management, file system shell, inter-process communication (IPC), and threading/multithreading.

## Contents

This repository primarily focuses on the following topics:

- **Process Management**:
  - Implementation of child, parent, zombie, and orphan processes.
- **File System Shell Implementations**:
  - Codes related to basic file system operations and shell commands.
- **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**:
  - Programs demonstrating piping, single shared memory, and producer-consumer problem.
- **Threading and Multithreading**:
  - Examples of threading and multithreading concepts.
