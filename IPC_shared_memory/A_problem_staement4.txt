Write a C/C++ program “process.c” to do the followings:

1.  A parent process P will create a child process Q. The parent process create a shared memory of size
    1024 bytes.

2. P and Q will attached them with the shared memory.

3. P writes a matrix A = [aij ]n×n to the shared memory and Q reads it.

4. Q writes a matrix B = [bij ]n×n to the shared memory and P reads it.

5. P will compute C = A × B and Q will computes D = B × A.

6. P and Q will detach them with the shared memory.

7. P will destroy the shared memory.
